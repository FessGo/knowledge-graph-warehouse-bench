Experiment evaluations for paper "KGFabric: A scalable knowledge graph warehouse for enterprise data interconnection".

Please see graph-analysis/, graph-fabric/ and graph-import/ subdirectories for detailed instructions to the experiments related to each system.

The open-source work for KGFabric system is still ongoing. The code base only consists of benchmark code, which includes implementations of ODPS SQL, Geaflow VC (Java API), KGDSL (a GQL-like KG reasoner language developed by Ant Group), and import scripts.
