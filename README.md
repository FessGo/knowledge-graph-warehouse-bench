Evaluations for paper "KGFabric: A scalable knowledge graph warehouse for enterprise data interconnection".

1. We extended LDBC Finbench datagen by incorporating the best modeling practices present by [OpenSPG project](https://github.com/OpenSPG/openspg), in order to enrich the semantic depth of the dataset.
The extended data generator is located at ```dataset``` subdirectory.

2. Workloads for graph analysis and fabric are also provided,  which includes implementations of ODPS SQL, Geaflow VC (Java API), KGDSL (a GQL-like KG reasoner language developed by Ant Group). Please see ```workloads``` subdirectory.

3. Some of useful scripts for data import are included in ```scripts``` subdirectory.
